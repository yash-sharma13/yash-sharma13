## 👋 Hey, I'm Yash Sharma (@yash-sharma13)

I'm a curious tech guy who got into tech not by the rulebook, but by passion and experimentation. I enjoy building things that make machines a bit smarter, whether that's through AI automation or my frustrated mind at 3AM, survivng with a cup of coffee.

### 🧠 What I’m Into
- 🧩 Building AI/ML powered apps & intelligent agents
- 🗂️ Designing RAG systems and multimodal pipelines
- 📊 Playing with data (structured, unstructured, weird-shaped — all welcome)
- 🛠️ Learning DevOps stuff like **CI/CD**, GitLab pipelines, and Azure automations
- 🧑‍💻 Contributing to open source (you learn things there you won't learn anywhere else)

### 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Tools:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI, LLMs, Git, Jenkins, AWS, Azure, GitLab CI

### 🤝 Open to Collaborations
If a project sparks my curiosity, I'm all in — feel free to reach out if you think I’m a good fit for something you're building. Whether it's open-source or side-projects, I'm always up for learning and contributing.
